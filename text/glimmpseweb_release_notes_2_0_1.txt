GLIMMPSE Web 2.0.1 Release Notes
--------------------------------------------

Bug Fixes

- Users can now save designs from Matrix mode
- Fixed bug in construction of interaction hypotheses which 
included multiple within participant factors (i.e. nested repeated
measures)

Known Issues

- We are still working on improving error messages when only a subset of 
power calculations fail.
- Extremely large sample sizes (> 100K) may lead to numerical
overflows and yield lower than expected power values, or
may fail due to invalid degrees of freedom in the underlying
F approximations
