GLIMMPSE Web 2.0.0 Release Notes
--------------------------------------------

Features

- Full redesign of the user interface look and feel
- Added left navigation bar which allows the user to jump
  directly to specific screens in the GLIMMPSE wizard
- Added support for multilevel and longitudinal designs
- Redesigned hypothesis screen to support trends and interactions
- Redesigned covariance screen to support the LEAR (Simpson 2010)
  model, as well as unstructured covariance and correlation models
- Redesigned user interface for specifying power curves

Internal Features

- Rewrite of communication layer to use StudyDesign object model
(see the WebServiceCommon library for details)
- Integrated Piriti library to automate encoding of StudyDesign
  objects into JSON
- Redesign of internal callback to use a central StudyDesignContext object

Dependency Changes

- Now uses WebServiceCommon 1.1.0 library for communication to web services
- Integrated Piriti 0.8 for JSON serialization
- Now uses ListGrid class from Smart GWT 3.0

Bug Fixes

- When solving for sample size, designs with no mean difference will
now return power = Type I error rate, and a sample size = -1, rather than
causing an infinite loop

Known Issues

- We are still working on improving error messages when only a subset of 
power calculations fail.
- Extremely large sample sizes (> 100K) may lead to numerical
overflows and yield lower than expected power values, or
may fail due to invalid degrees of freedom in the underlying
F approximations
