	<h3>About Us</h3>
	<p>
	The GLIMMPSE software was developed at the Colorado School of Public Health, Department of Biostatistics and Informatics
	at the University of Colorado Denver.  
	</p>
	<p>
	Colorado School of Public Health: Established July 1, 2008, the new Colorado School of
	Public Health is the first and only school of public health in the Rocky Mountain Region,
	attracting top tier faculty and students from across the county, and providing a vital contribution
	toward ensuring our regionâ€™s health and well-being. Collaboratively formed by the University of Colorado Denver, 
	Colorado State University and the University of Northern Colorado, CSPH
	provides training, innovative research and community service to actively address public health
	issues, including chronic disease, access to health care, environmental threats, emerging
	infectious disease, and costly injuries.
	</p>
	<p>
	The mission of the Colorado School of Public Health is to promote the physical, mental,
	social and environmental health of people and communities in the Rocky Mountain Region and
	globally. The mission will be accomplished through collaborations in education, population based
	research, and community service that bring together institutions, agencies and diverse
	populations.
    </p>
	<p>
	The software was written by 	<a href="http://bios.ucdenver.edu/index.php/Sarah_Kreidler">Dr. Sarah Kreidler</a>
	with support from  NCI K07CA88811, a grant from the National 
		Cancer Institute to the Colorado School of Public Health, 
		<a href="http://ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/PublicHealth/departments/Biostatistics/About/Faculty/Pages/GlueckD.aspx">
		Dr. Deborah Glueck</a>, Principal Investigator.
   </p>
   <p>
   The power calculations are based on	the work of 
   	<a href="http://www.health-outcomes-policy.ufl.edu/muller/">Professor Keith E. Muller</a> at the University of Florida.  
	Appropriate citations for the supporting publications are available on the 
	<a href="publications.html">related publications</a> page.
