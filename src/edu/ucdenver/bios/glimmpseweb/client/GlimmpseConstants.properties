# solving for panel
solvingForLink = Solving For
solvingForTitle = Would you like to solve for power or sample size?
solvingForDescription = To begin your calculation, please indicate whether you would like to solve for power or total sample size. \
<p> \
If you have a rough idea of the number of research participants you will be able to recruit, then solving for power may be more beneficial. <p>\
If you have fewer restrictions on recruitment and would like to ensure a well-powered study, then solving for sample size \
is likely to be more useful.
solvingForPowerLabel = Power
solvingForSampleSizeLabel = Total Sample Size
solvingForEffectSizeLabel = Effect Size
solvingForNominalPowerTitle = Power Values
solvingForNominalPowerDescription = Enter the desired power values in the list box below. \
 Power values are numbers between 0 and 1.  Higher values correspond to a greater likelihood of rejecting \
 the null hypothesis.  Common  values are 0.8 or 0.9, although 0.9 or higher is usually preferred.  <p>Type each value into the list box and click "Add". \
 To remove an item, highlight the value and click the "Delete" button.
solvingForNominalPowerInstructions = Type the power values into the text box and click "Add". \
 You may enter up to 5 values.  To remove a value, select it in the list box and click the "Delete" button.
solvingForNominalPowerTableColumn = Power Values

### Type I Error Group ###
# alpha intro panel
alphaIntroTitle = Type I Error - Introduction
alphaIntroDescription = Type I error indicates the probability of incorrectly identifying a significant difference \
when there is none (i.e. rejecting a true null hypothesis).  Type I error values should \
be decimals between 0 and 1.  The most commonly used values are 0.01, 0.05, and \
0.1.
# alpha panel
alphaTitle = Type I Error
alphaDescription = A Type I error occurs when a scientist declares a difference when none is actually present. \
The Type I error rate is the probability of a Type I error occurring, and is often referred to as &alpha;. \
 Type I error rates range from 0 to 1.  The most commonly used values are 0.01, 0.05, and \
0.1.<p></p>Enter each Type I error value into the text box and click "Add".  You may enter up to 5 \
values.  To remove a value, select the value in the list box and click the "Delete" button.

### Participants group ###
# intro panel
participantsIntroTitle = Independent Sample Unit: Introduction
participantsIntroDescription = In this section, you will describe features which distinguish \
independent observations.\
<ul>.\
<li>Independent observations have values which are statistically independent.</li>\
<li>An independent sampling unit (ISU) provides one or more observations such that \
observations from one unit are statistically independent from any other distinct unit \
 while observations from the same unit may be correlated.</li>\
<li>The observational unit distinguishes one correlated observation from another within the ISU.</li>\
<li>Observing the same variable in two or more instances across time, space, or other dimension \
within an ISU creates repeated measures.</li>\
<li>Commensurate observations share the same measurement scale and units.</li>\
<li>Multivariate outcomes arise from a single ISU and therefore are not independent \
and need not be commensurate.</li>\
<li>Doubly multivariate outcomes include repeated measures of two or more noncommensurate variables</li>\
</ul>\
(Quoted from <a href="link-to-muller-and-stewart">Muller & Stewart 2007</a>, definition 6.1)


For cluster randomized designs, the independent sampling unit is the cluster, such as schools or families. \
 When individual participants \
are randomized, then the independent sampling unit is the participant.


#This includes fixed predictors such as treatment group or gender, \
#group sizes, and clustering if applicable.

### Outcomes group ###
responsesIntroTitle = Responses Introduction
responsesIntroDescription = Responses are the quantitative outcomes of interest  \
in a study. In this section, you will describe the response variables measured in your \
study.  If the response variables were measured on multiple occasions for each participant, \
you may describe the type and timing of the repeated measurements. \
<p/>Click the forward arrow to continue.
# outcomes panel
responseVariablesTitle = Response Variables
responseVariablesDescription = Enter the response variables in the table below.  \
For example, in a study investigating \
cholesterol-lowering medication, the response variable could be HDL, LDL, and total cholesterol.\
<p>\
Note that repeated measurement information will be addressed on the next screen.
outcomesLabelRepeated = Number of measurement repetitions: 
responseVariablesTableColumn = Response Variables

# Repeated Measures Panel
repeatedMeasuresTitle =Repeated Measures
repeatedMeasuresHeader = 
repeatedMeasuresDescription = Repeated measures are present when a response variable \
is measured on each research participant on two or more occasions or under \
two or more conditions.<p/>If the study includes repeated measurements, click \
\u201CAdd repeated measures\u201D and follow the prompts.  The text entered in the "Units" \
text box indicates the dimension \
over which measures were taken (ex. time, days, locations, etc.).  The choice of "Type" \
indicates whether the repeated measures are numeric (ex. time), ordinal (ex. 1st, 2nd, 3rd), or categorical \
(ex. arm, leg, hand).<p/>You may specify up to 3 levels of repeated measures.<p/>
repeatedMeasuresNodePanelDimensionLabel = Units

# predictors panel
predictorsTitle = Study Groups
predictorsDescription = Describe the predictors which assign independent sampling units \
into groups, such as gender or treatment.  If the study includes only one group, select the \
"One group" button.  If the study includes multiple groups, select the " Multiple groups" button.



#Here you will specify the characteristics of participants in \
#your study.  First, indicate whether you have a single group of participants or \
#multiple groups.
predictorsMultiSampleDescription = In the table below, specify the fixed predictors. The choice of study \
design determines  the values of fixed predictors (such as drug dose or gender).  A common example of a \
fixed predictor is treatment group, for which the independent sampling unit is randomized to a \
placebo or an active drug group.  \
 <p> \
 To enter fixed predictors: \
 <ol>\
 <li>Enter the name of each predictor in the left text box and click "Add".  For example, one might enter \
 "treatment" as a predictor.</li>\
 <li>Select the predictor from the left text box to display the current list of values associated with the predictor.  \
 To add a new value, enter the  value in the "Category" text box and click "Add".  For example, one could select \
 "treatment", then add \
 the values "drug" and "placebo."</li> \
 </ol><p></p> \
 Each predictor should have at least two values.
predictorsOneSampleButton = One group
predictorsMultiSampleButton = Multiple groups

 
covariateTitle = Controlling for a single, normally distributed predictor
covariateDescription = A common experimental design is an analysis of covariance, which \
includes one or more fixed predictors and one or more continous control variables, the "covariates." \
For example, one might run an experiment with 10 males and \
10 females, with an indicator variable for gender as a fixed predictor and age as a covariate.  \
<p> \
A common special case uses a series of repeated measurements on a continuous outcome.  \
The first measurement, observed prior to treatment, is used as a baseline covariate.  \
The other repeated measurements are \
outcomes in the general linear multivariate model.  \
<p>\
GLIMMPSE can calculate power for hypotheses concerning the fixed predictors, \
optionally controlling for a single normally distributed predictor.  If you plan to include a single \
normally distributed predictor in your model, click the check box below.\
<p> \
At present, the GLIMMPSE software does not calculate power for multiple normally distributed predictors nor \
non-normally distributed predictors.
predictorsTableColumn = Predictor
categoriesTableColumn = Category

predictorsCovariateDescription = Finally, you can control for a subject characteristic which does not have a predefined set of \
values, also known as a baseline covariate.  This could includes values such as age, height, systolic blood pressure, etc.  \
To control for a baseline covariate, name your covariate below.  The covariate is assumed to follow a normal distribution, \
so you will need to estimate the mean (average) and standard deviation for your variable.
matrixCovariateDescription = You may control for a single baseline covariate by clicking the checkbox below, \
and specifying a mean and standard deviation for the variable.  The covariate is assumed to follow a normal \
distribution
covariateCheckBoxLabel = Control for a single, normally distributed predictor
covariateMeanLabel = Mean
covariateStandardDeviationLabel = Standard Deviation


# study groups panel
studyGroupsTitle = Group Sizes
studyGroupsDescription = On this panel, you will specify the relative and actual sizes of your study groups.
perGroupSampleSizeTitle = Size of the Smallest Group
perGroupSampleSizeDescription = Enter the number of independent sampling units (participants, clusters) \
in the smallest group in the study.  If your group sizes are equal, the value is the same for all groups. \
You may enter multiple values for the smallest group size in order to consider a range of total sample sizes. \
<p> \
Enter one or more sample sizes in the text box below and click "Add".  To \
remove a sample size from the list, highlight it and click the "Delete" button.
perGroupSampleSizeTableColumn =  Size of the Smallest Group
equalGroupsLabel = Use equal group sizes
relativeGroupSizeTitle = Relative Group Sizes
relativeGroupSizeDescription = Specify whether the study subgroups are of equal or unequal size.<p> \
For equal group sizes, select a "1" in the drop-down list next to each study subgroup.  This is the default study design. \
<p> \
For unequal group sizes, specify the ratio of the group sizes.  For example, consider a design with \
an active drug group and a placebo group.  If twice as many study participants \
receive the placebo, a value of "2" would be selected for the placebo group, \
and a value of "1" would be selected for the active drug group.
relativeGroupSizeTableColumn = Relative<br>Group Size

### Hypothesis group ###
hypothesisIntroTitle = Study Hypotheses - Introduction
hypothesisIntroDescription = Power and sample size calculations are typically based on the primary study \
hypothesis.  GLIMMPSE will generate several possible hypotheses based on your study design. \
Click the forward arrow to continue.  
# hypothesis panel
hypothesisTitle =  Hypotheses
hypothesisDescription = The list below shows the hypotheses which are available for the current study design. \
Select the hypothesis which most closely resembles your primary study hypothesis.  Trends within an interaction \
hypothesis are specified in the "Interaction" tab.  This \
hypothesis will be used to determine power for your study.\
<p/>The tab highlighted in "white" indicates the currently selected hypothesis.  For more information \
about the type of hypothesis, click the magnifying glass icon.
hypothesisPanelGrandMean = Grand mean
hypothesisPanelGrandMeanExplanation = Tests of the grand mean compare the overall mean response \
in a sample of participants against a known value.  For example, an investigator may wish to determine \
if body mass index \
values for participants in a particular state differs from the United States national average.<p/> \
If a study design includes fixed predictors or repeated measures, the grand mean hypothesis will average \
across all factors.
hypothesisPanelMainEffect = Main Effect
hypothesisPanelMainEffectExplanation = Main effect hypotheses test for the effect of a single predictor \
variable averaged across all other factors.  For example, testing if responses of participants \
in the treatment group differ on average from participant responses in a placebo group is a common \
main effect hypothesis.  
hypothesisPanelInteraction = Interaction
hypothesisPanelInteractionExplanation = Interaction effect hypotheses test if the effect of one predictor \
changes depending on the value of one or more additional predictors.  \
An interaction test also can be interpreted as a test of differences \
of differences, as well as a test of parallel trajectories of response. \
<p/>For example, testing if the effect of a \
cholesterol lowering medication on total serum cholesterol differs depending on the participant's gender \
is an example of an interaction hypothesis.  
hypothesisPanelTrend = Trend
hypothesisPanelTrendExplanation = Trend hypotheses test if the effect of a single predictor follows \
a particular polynomial pattern, such as a linear or quadratic trend, across different levels of the predictor.
hypothesisPanelSelectTypeOfTrend = Select the type of trend
# trends
hypothesisTrendPanelNoTrend = No trend
hypothesisTrendPanelLinear = Linear
hypothesisTrendPanelQuadratic = Quadratic
hypothesisTrendPanelCubic = Cubic

First, select one predictor of interest to test.  Second, select the type of trend you wish \
to test.
# one sample panel constants
grandMeanHypothesisPanelText = Enter the known mean values for each response \
below. 

# mean difference panels
meanDifferenceIntroTitle = Means - Introduction
meanDifferenceIntroDescription = In power analysis, it is necessary to provide mean values for the outcomes. \
 The means are often obtained from published results or pilot data. \
To detect a difference between the groups, at least two subgroups should have means which differ by \
a scientifically meaningful amount.<p></p>  \
For example, in a study of cholesterol-lowering medication, we would expect the mean cholesterol level in the active drug group to \
be lower than the placebo group. <p></p>\
Click next to specify the means you expect to observe.
meanDifferenceRepeatedMeasuresInstructions = Select the time (location, etc.) from the list(s) below.  This \
will allow you to edit the means at the selected time (location, etc.).
meanDifferenceTitle = Means
meanDifferenceDescription = The table below shows the mean values for each outcome within each study subgroup. \
The study subgroups are listed along the left hand side of the table, and the outcomes are listed across the top. <p></p>\
Enter the mean values you expect to observe for each outcome within each study subgroup.  The table should contain at least \
one value that is non-zero. Also, at least two subgroups should have means which differ by a scientifically meaningful amount.
meanDifferenceMainEffectHypothesis = You've selected a primary hypothesis which examines the main effect of 
meanDifferenceMainEffectQuestion = What is the minimum difference of means you would like to be able \
to detect for different levels/groups of 
meanDifferenceInteractionEffectHypothesis = You've selected a primary hypothesis which examines the interaction effect between 
meanDifferenceInteractionEffectQuestion = An interaction effect is a "difference of differences," which measures how much the effect of \
one factors changes based on levels of a second factor.  For example, if a hypertension medication lowers systolic blood pressure by \
20 mmHg in males, but only 5 mmHg in females when compared against a placebo group, then the magnitude of the interaction \
effect would be 15 mmHg.  <p></p>In the text boxes below, enter the minimum "difference of differences" you would like to be able to detect \
for each of your outcomes.  That is, enter the amount by which you expect the effect of 
meanDifferenceInteractionEffectQuestionMiddle = to change for different groups/levels of 
meanDifferencePatternTitle = Estimated Pattern of Mean Differences
meanDifferencePatternDescription = Based on your study hypothesis, the graphs below show some common patterns \
of group means that may be observed.  Select the graph that best matches the pattern of mean differences that \
you wish to detect with your study.
meanDifferenceScaleTitle = Flexible Means
meanDifferenceScaleDescription = Power and sample size results will change depending on the mean \
values specified on the previous screen.   It is not possible to know exact values for the means until the experiment \
is observed.  To account for the uncertainty, it is common to calculate \
power for the mean values as specified, the mean values divided by 2, and the mean values multiplied by 2.<p></p>
meanDifferenceScaleQuestion = 
meanDifferenceScaleAnswer = Yes, include power calculations for the mean values as entered, the mean values divided by 2, \
and the mean values multiplied by 2.

## variability group
variabilityIntroTitle = Variability - Introduction
variabilityIntroDescription = Power analysis requires information about the variability in the study outcomes. \
 In this section, you will provide standard deviations and correlations for the study outcomes and the \
covariate (if specified). <p></p> \
Click the forward arrow to continue.  
# sigma error panel
variabilityErrorTitle = Standard Deviations and Correlations of Outcomes
variabilityErrorDescription = The list below Standard deviations are measures of variability.  Correlations describe the strength \
of the association between two variables.  This is commonly reported as a standard deviation \
in the literature.  
# sigma covariate panel
variabilityCovariateTitle = Variability in the Gaussian Covariate
variabilityCovariateDescription = Enter the standard deviation of the Gaussian covariate in the text box below:
variabilityCovariateQuestion = 
# sigma outcome panel
variabilityOutcomeTitle = Standard Deviations and Correlations of Outcomes
variabilityOutcomeDescription =  Standard deviations are measures of variability.  In the list below, enter standard deviations \
for each of the study outcomes.  The standard deviation value should reflect the variability <i>within</i> a study subgroup.  <p></p> \
For example, consider a study comparing heart rate between males and females.  We could calculate an \
overall standard deviation, a standard deviation within males, and a standard deviation within females.  For a power analysis, \
we would select either the male standard deviation or the female standard deviation, but not the overall value.  Alternatively, we \
could obtain a weighted average of the standard deviations for males and females. <p></p> \
For designs with multiple outcomes, you will also need to specify correlations between the outcomes.  Correlations measure the \
strength of the association between two outcomes.<p></p>
variabilityOutcomeQuestion = Enter the standard deviation for each outcome listed below:
correlationOutcomeQuestion = Enter the correlations between each pair of outcomes below:
# sigma covariate outcome panel

# variability panel
variabilityTitle = Variability of Outcome Measures
variabilityDescription = Here you will estimate the variability you expect to see in your outcome measures.
# sigma scale panel
variabilityScaleTitle = Flexible Variability
variabilityScaleDescription = On the previous screens, you entered standard deviations and correlations.  \
GLIMMPSE has used these values to calculate a covariance matrix which describes the overall variability. <p></p> \
Changes in variability can dramatically affect power and sample size results. \
 It is not possible to know the variability until the experiment is observed.  \
 To account for this uncertainty, it is common to calculate power or sample size \
for alternative values for variability.  <p></p> \
By clicking the box below, GLIMMPSE will calculate power using the calculated covariance matrix, the covariance matrix \
divided by 2, and the covariance matrix multiplied by 2.<p></p>
variabilityScaleQuestion = 
variabilityScaleAnswer = Yes, include power for the covariance matrix, the covariance matrix \
divided by 2, and the covariance matrix multiplied by 2.

powerMethodTitle = Power Calculation Method
powerMethodDescription = For designs including a baseline covariate, two methods are available to calculate \
power: unconditional power and quantile power. One can think of the random covariate values as having been \
sampled from a normal distribution.  Thus there are many possible realizations of the same experiment, \
and each realization may have a different power.  The unconditional power is defined as the average of the \
possible power values (Gatsonis and Sampson, 1989; Glueck and Muller, 2003).  The <i>100 x v<sup>th</sup></i> \
quantile power is the power value chosen so that power as small or smaller occurs in \
<i>100 x v</i> percent of all possible realizations of the experiment. \
<p></p>\
For a detailed description of unconditional and quantile power, please see \
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2813654">Gatsonis and Sampson (1989)</a> and \

for each independent sampling unit in \
a model containing only the fixed predictors and excluding the Gaussian covariate.<p></p>\
For univariate designs, <b>&Sigma;</b><sub>y</sub> will be a 1x1 matrix containing the \

# ClusteringPanel and ClusteringNodePanel constants
clusteringPanelTitle = Clustering
clusteringPanelDescription = In a clustered design, the independent sampling unit is a cluster, \
such as a community, school, or classroom.  Observations within a cluster are correlated. \
The labels for observations within a cluster must be exchangeable.  For example, child "id" within \
classroom can be reassigned arbitrarily. In contrast, observations across time cannot be reassigned and \
should not be considered clustered observations.  Clustering, or repeated measures, or a combination, \
creates a multilevel design.  The common correlation between any pair of cluster members is termed the \
intraclass correlation or intracluster correlation. \

rateOfDecayOfCorrelationExplinationHeader = Decay Rate
rateOfDecayOfCorrelationExplinationText= When repeated measurements are taken over time, it \
is often the case that measurements taken closer together are more strongly correlated \
than those taken farther apart in time.  The decay rate, or &delta; as defined by  \
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20658550">Simpson et al. (2010)</a>, \
specifies how quickly the correlation between two measurements decreases as the spacing \
between measurements increases. <p>\
A value of 0 indicates that the correlation is constant, regardless of spacing.  This is also known as \
compound symmetry.  Higher rates lead to a faster decay in correlation.\
<p/>\
Our experience with biological and behavioral data lead us to suggest using decay values between \
0.05 and 0.5.
