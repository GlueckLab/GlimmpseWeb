solvingForTitle = Would you like to solve for power or sample size?
solvingForDescription = To begin your calculation, please indicate whether you would like to solve for power or total sample size. \
<p> \
If you have a rough idea of the number of research participants you will be able to recruit, then solving for power may be more beneficial. <p>\
If you have fewer restrictions on recruitment and would like to ensure a well-powered study, then solving for sample size \
is likely to be more useful.
solvingForPowerLabel = Power
solvingForSampleSizeLabel = Total Sample Size
solvingForEffectSizeLabel = Effect Size
solvingForNominalPowerTitle = Power Values
solvingForNominalPowerDescription = Enter the desired power values in the list below. \

### Type I Error Group ###
# alpha intro panel
alphaIntroTitle = Type I Error - Introduction
alphaIntroDescription = Type I error indicates the probability of incorrectly identifying a significant difference \
when there is none (i.e. rejecting a true null hypothesis).  Type I error values should \
be decimals between 0 and 1.  The most commonly used values are 0.01, 0.05, and \
0.1.
# alpha panel

### Predictors group ###
# intro panel
predictorsIntroTitle = Predictors - Introduction
predictorsIntroDescription = Predictors, or independent variables, are the values you manipulate or control in the study design. \
Click next to specify the study predictors.


### Outcomes group ###
outcomesIntroTitle = Outcomes - Introduction
outcomesIntroDescription = Outcomes, or dependent variables, are the events of interest  \
in an experiment. Click "Next" to enter your study outcomes.
# outcomes panel
outcomesTitle = Outcomes
outcomesDescription = Enter the study outcomes in the table below.  \
Outcomes are the dependent variables in the study.  For example, in a study investigating \
cholesterol-lowering medication, the outcome could be serum cholesterol levels.
outcomesLabelRepeated = Number of measurement repetitions: 
outcomesTableColumn = Outcomes

# Repeated Measures Panel
repeatedMeasuresTitle =Repeated Measures
repeatedMeasuresHeader = Repeated measures are present when multiple measurements are taken on each \
research participant.
repeatedMeasuresDescription = If you plan to perform repeated measurements, click \u201CAdd repeated measures\u201D and follow the \
prompts.  Otherwise, click next to continue.
repeatedMeasuresDescription1 = Describe the way in which measurements will be repeated in your planned study.  To\
revert back to a study with no repeated measures, click \u201CRemove repeated measures\u201D\
 at the bottom of the screen
repeatedMeasuresInstructions = Repeated measures may be performed over multiple nested dimensions (explain).\
Enter the dimension which varies most slowly
repeatedOverTableColumn = Repeated Over
repetitionsTableColumn = # Repetitions
singleMeasureLabel = No, measurements were only taken one time.
repeatedMeasures1DLabel = Yes, measurements were repeated over a single dimension (ex. days, weeks, locations, etc.)
repeatedMeasures2DLabel = Yes, measurements were repeated over two dimensions (ex. over weeks, and within each week \
over multiple days)
repeatedMeasuresRepeatsLabel = How many times?
repeatedMeasuresUnitsLabel = Over what dimension?
# predictors panel
predictorsTitle = Study Groups
predictorsDescription = Here you will specify the characteristics of subjects in your study.  This will help define the \
groups involved in your study.
categoricalTitle = Fixed Predictors
categoricalDescription = In the table below, specify any fixed predictors. The choice of study design determines \
 the values of fixed predictors (such as drug dose or gender).  A common example of a fixed predictor is treatment group, \
where research participants may be randomized to a placebo or an active drug group.  \
 <p> \
 To enter fixed predictors: \
 <ol>\
 <li>Enter the name of each predictor in the left text box and click "Add".  For example, one might enter "treatment" as a predictor.</li>\
 <li>Enter all possible values for each predictor.  To do so, select the predictor from the left text box. \
 This will display the current list of values associated with the predictor.  To add a new value, enter the \
 value in the "Category" text box and click "Add".  For example, one could select "treatment", then add \
 the values "drug" and "placebo."</li> \
 </ol><p></p> \
 Each predictor should have at least one value.
 
covariateTitle = Controlling for a Single Gaussian Predictor
covariateDescription = A common experimental design is analysis of covariance.  Analysis of covariance \
includes one or more fixed predictors. For example, one might run an experiment with 10 males and \
10 females, with an indicator variable for gender as a fixed predictor.  In addition, the design typically includes \
a single Gaussian predictor.  \
<p> \
A common special case of analysis of covariance is the baseline covariate design.  In such a design, a scientist \
records a series of repeated measurements on a continuous outcome.  The first one is measured at the start of \
the experiment and is commonly called the baseline covariate.  The other repeated measurements are used \
as outcomes in the general linear multivariate model.  A baseline covariate often explains \
a useful proportion of the variance of outcomes, thus increasing the \
power for the hypotheses of interest. \
<p>\
GLIMMPSE can calculate power for hypotheses concerning the fixed predictors, \
optionally controlling for a single Gaussian predictor.  If you plan to include a single \
Guassian predictor in your model, click the check box below.\
<p> \
At present, the GLIMMPSE software does not calculate power for multiple Gaussian predictors nor \
non-normally distributed predictors.
predictorsTableColumn = Predictor
categoriesTableColumn = Category

predictorsCovariateDescription = Finally, you can control for a subject characteristic which does not have a predefined set of \
values, also known as a baseline covariate.  This could includes values such as age, height, systolic blood pressure, etc.  \
To control for a baseline covariate, name your covariate below.  The covariate is assumed to follow a normal distribution, \
so you will need to estimate the mean (average) and standard deviation for your variable.
matrixCovariateDescription = You may control for a single baseline covariate by clicking the checkbox below, \
and specifying a mean and standard deviation for the variable.  The covariate is assumed to follow a normal \
distribution
covariateCheckBoxLabel = Control for a single Gaussian predictor
covariateMeanLabel = Mean
covariateStandardDeviationLabel = Standard Deviation


# study groups panel
studyGroupsTitle = Group Sizes
studyGroupsDescription = On this panel, you will specify the relative and actual sizes of your study groups.
perGroupSampleSizeTitle = Per Group Sample Sizes
perGroupSampleSizeDescription = Enter the number of participants you intend to recruit for each group in your study. \
If your group sizes are equal, specify the number of study participants within each group.  For unequal group sizes, \
specify the number of study participants in the smallest group. \
<p> \
In many cases, it is not possible to know the exact number of participants that will be recruited for a study. \
Therefore, you may calculate power for several possible values for the per group sample size.  If you are unsure of \
the exact number of participants in each group, a reasonable approach would be calculate power for your target \
per group sample size, as well as half and twice that value. \
<p> \
Enter the per group sample sizes in the text box below and click enter.  To \
remove a per group sample size from the list, highlight it and click the "Delete" button.
perGroupSampleSizeTableColumn = Per Group Sample Size
equalGroupsLabel = Use equal group sizes
relativeGroupSizeTitle = Relative Group Sizes
relativeGroupSizeDescription = Specify whether the study subgroups are of equal or unequal size.<p> \
For equal group sizes, select a "1" in the drop-down list next to each study subgroup.  This is the default study design. \
<p> \
For unequal group sizes, specify the ratio of the group sizes.  For example, consider a design with \
an active drug group and a placebo group.  If twice as many study participants \
receive the placebo, a value of "2" would be selected for the placebo group, \
and a value of "1" would be selected for the active drug group.
relativeGroupSizeTableColumn = Relative<br>Group Size

### Hypothesis group ###
hypothesisIntroTitle = Study Hypotheses - Introduction
hypothesisIntroDescription = Power and sample size calculations are typically based on the primary study \
hypothesis.  GLIMMPSE will generate several possible hypotheses based on your study design. \
Click "Next" to select a hypothesis.  
# hypothesis panel
hypothesisTitle =  Hypotheses
hypothesisDescription = The list below shows the hypotheses which are available for the current study design. \
Select the hypothesis which most closely resembles your primary study hypothesis.  This \
hypothesis will be used to determine power for your study.

# mean difference panels
meanDifferenceIntroTitle = Means - Introduction
meanDifferenceIntroDescription = In power analysis, it is necessary to provide mean values for the outcomes. \
 The means are often obtained from published results or pilot data. \
To detect a difference between the groups, at least two subgroups should have means which differ by \
a scientifically meaningful amount.<p></p>  \
For example, in a study of cholesterol-lowering medication, we would expect the mean cholesterol level in the active drug group to \
be lower than the placebo group. <p></p>\
Click next to specify the means you expect to observe.
meanDifferenceTitle = Means
meanDifferenceDescription = The table below shows the mean values for each outcome within each study subgroup. \
The study subgroups are listed along the left hand side of the table, and the outcomes are listed across the top. <p></p>\
Enter the mean values you expect to observe for each outcome within each study subgroup.  The table should contain at least \
one value that is non-zero. Also, at least two subgroups should have means which differ by a scientifically meaningful amount.
meanDifferenceMainEffectHypothesis = You've selected a primary hypothesis which examines the main effect of 
meanDifferenceMainEffectQuestion = What is the minimum difference of means you would like to be able \
to detect for different levels/groups of 
meanDifferenceInteractionEffectHypothesis = You've selected a primary hypothesis which examines the interaction effect between 
meanDifferenceInteractionEffectQuestion = An interaction effect is a "difference of differences," which measures how much the effect of \
one factors changes based on levels of a second factor.  For example, if a hypertension medication lowers systolic blood pressure by \
20 mmHg in males, but only 5 mmHg in females when compared against a placebo group, then the magnitude of the interaction \
effect would be 15 mmHg.  <p></p>In the text boxes below, enter the minimum "difference of differences" you would like to be able to detect \
for each of your outcomes.  That is, enter the amount by which you expect the effect of 
meanDifferenceInteractionEffectQuestionMiddle = to change for different groups/levels of 
meanDifferencePatternTitle = Estimated Pattern of Mean Differences
meanDifferencePatternDescription = Based on your study hypothesis, the graphs below show some common patterns \
of group means that may be observed.  Select the graph that best matches the pattern of mean differences that \
you wish to detect with your study.
meanDifferenceScaleTitle = Flexible Means
meanDifferenceScaleDescription = Power and sample size results will change depending on the mean \
values specified on the previous screen.   It is not possible to know exact values for these means until the experiment \
is observed.  To account for this uncertainty, it is common to calculate \
power for the mean values as specified, the mean values divided by 2, and the mean values multiplied by 2.<p></p>
meanDifferenceScaleQuestion = 
meanDifferenceScaleAnswer = Yes, include power calculations for the mean values as entered, the mean values divided by 2, \
and the mean values multiplied by 2.

## variability group
variabilityIntroTitle = Variability - Introduction
variabilityIntroDescription = In the previous section, you provided information about the mean values of the study outcomes. \
Power analysis also requires information about the variability in the study outcomes.  In this section, you will be asked to provide \
standard deviations and correlations for the study outcomes and the Gaussian covariate (if specified). <p></p> \
Click "Next" to continue.
# sigma error panel
variabilityErrorTitle = Standard Deviations and Correlations of Outcomes
variabilityErrorDescription = The list below Standard deviations are measures of variability.  Correlations describe the strength \
of the association between two variables.  This is commonly reported as a standard deviation \
in the literature.  
# sigma covariate panel
variabilityCovariateTitle = Variability in the Gaussian Covariate
variabilityCovariateDescription = Enter the standard deviation of the Gaussian covariate in the text box below:
variabilityCovariateQuestion = 
# sigma outcome panel
variabilityOutcomeTitle = Standard Deviations and Correlations of Outcomes
variabilityOutcomeDescription =  Standard deviations are measures of variability.  In the list below, enter standard deviations \
for each of the study outcomes.  The standard deviation value should reflect the variability <i>within</i> a study subgroup.  <p></p> \
For example, consider a study comparing heart rate between males and females.  We could calculate an \
overall standard deviation, a standard deviation within males, and a standard deviation within females.  For a power analysis, \
we would select either the male standard deviation or the female standard deviation, but not the overall value.  Alternatively, we \
could obtain a weighted average of the standard deviations for males and females. <p></p> \
For designs with multiple outcomes, you will also need to specify correlations between the outcomes.  Correlations measure the \
strength of the association between two outcomes.<p></p>
variabilityOutcomeQuestion = Enter the standard deviation for each outcome listed below:
correlationOutcomeQuestion = Enter the correlations between each pair of outcomes below:
# sigma covariate outcome panel
variabilityCovariateOutcomeTitle = Association Between the Covariate and the Outcomes
variabilityCovariateOutcomeDescription = When controlling for a covariate, power \
will be affected by the strength of the association between the covariate and the study outcomes.  \
<p></p>Enter the correlation between the covariate and each outcome listed below.  
variabilityCovariateOutcomeQuestion = 

# variability panel
variabilityTitle = Variability of Outcome Measures
variabilityDescription = Here you will estimate the variability you expect to see in your outcome measures.
# sigma scale panel
variabilityScaleTitle = Flexible Variability
variabilityScaleDescription = On the previous screens, you entered standard deviations and correlations.  \
GLIMMPSE has used these values to calculate a covariance matrix which describes the overall variability. <p></p> \
Changes in variability can dramatically affect power and sample size results. \
 It is not possible to know the variability until the experiment is observed.  \
 To account for this uncertainty, it is common to calculate power or sample size \
for alternative values for variability.  <p></p> \
By clicking the box below, GLIMMPSE will calculate power using the calculated covariance matrix, the covariance matrix \
divided by 2, and the covariance matrix multiplied by 2.<p></p>
variabilityScaleQuestion = 
variabilityScaleAnswer = Yes, include power for the covariance matrix, the covariance matrix \
divided by 2, and the covariance matrix multiplied by 2.

testWilksLambdaLabel = Wilks Likelihood Ratio
testPillaiBartlettTraceLabel = Pillai-Bartlett Trace
testHotellingLawleyTraceLabel = Hotelling-Lawley Trace
powerMethodTitle = Power Calculation Method
powerMethodDescription = For designs including a baseline covariate, two methods are available to calculate \
power: unconditional power and quantile power. One can think of the random covariate values as having been \
sampled from a Gaussian distribution.  Thus there are many possible realizations of the same experiment, \
and each realization may have a different power.  The unconditional power is defined as the average of the \
possible power values (Gatsonis and Sampson, 1989; Glueck and Muller, 2003).  The <i>100 x v<sup>th</sup></i> \
quantile power is the power value chosen so that power as small or smaller occurs in \
<i>100 x v</i> percent of all possible realizations of the experiment. \
<p></p>\
For a detailed description of unconditional and quantile power, please see \
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2813654">Gatsonis and Sampson (1989)</a> and \

# covariance matrices
sigmaErrorTitle = Covariance of Errors: &Sigma;<sub>e</sub> Matrix
sigmaErrorDescription = For each independent sampling unit, <b>&Sigma;</b><sub>e</sub> is the covariance of the \
random errors. For univariate designs, <b>&Sigma;</b><sub>e</sub> will be a 1x1 matrix containing the \
variance of the error term.  More complex structures may be entered for \
multivariate or repeated measures designs. \
Values for <b>&Sigma;</b><sub>e</sub> are typically obtained from pilot data or previous studies. <p></p> \
<b>&Sigma;</b><sub>e</sub> is a square, symmetric matrix with dimensions equal to the number of columns in <b>B</b>. \
<p></p>\
Enter values for <b>&Sigma;</b><sub>e</sub> in matrix below.

sigmaCovariateTitle = Variance of the Gaussian Covariate: &sigma;<sup>2</sup><sub>g</sub>
sigmaCovariateDescription = The Gaussian covariate is assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution with \
mean zero and variance &sigma;<sup>2</sup><sub>g</sub>. <p></p>\
Enter values for &sigma;<sup>2</sup><sub>g</sub> in the matrix below. 
sigmaCovariateMatrixName = &sigma;<sup>2</sup><sub>g</sub>
sigmaOutcomeTitle = Covariance of Outcomes: &Sigma;<sub>y</sub>
sigmaOutcomeDescription = For each independent sampling unit, <b>&Sigma;</b><sub>y</sub> is the covariance of the \
outcomes conditional on the fixed predictors.  One can think of <b>&Sigma;</b><sub>y</sub> as the error covariance \
for each independent sampling unit in \
a model containing only the fixed predictors and excluding the Gaussian covariate.<p></p>\
For univariate designs, <b>&Sigma;</b><sub>y</sub> will be a 1x1 matrix containing the \
variance of the outcome conditional on the fixed predictors.  More complex structures may be entered for \
multivariate or repeated measures designs. \
<b>&Sigma;</b><sub>y</sub> is a square, symmetric matrix with dimensions equal to the number of columns in <b>B</b>. \
<p></p>\
Enter values for <b>&Sigma;</b><sub>y</sub> in the matrix below.
sigmaOutcomeMatrixName = &Sigma;<sub>y</sub> Matrix
sigmaOutcomeCovariateTitle = Covariance of Outcomes with Covariate: &Sigma;<sub>yg</sub>
sigmaOutcomeCovariateDescription = When controlling for a covariate, power increases if the covariate \
explains some portion of the variance in the outcome.  The <b>&Sigma;</b><sub>yg</sub> matrix defines the \
strength of the association between the covariate and the outcomes.  \
For univariate designs, <b>&Sigma;</b><sub>yg</sub> will be a 1x1 matrix containing the covariance \
between the outcome and the covariate. \
For multivariate and repeated measures designs, the matrix will be px1, where p is the number of outcomes, \
and each row contains the covariance between the covariate and the corresponding outcome. <p></p> \
Enter values for <b>&Sigma;</b><sub>yg</sub> in the matrix below.
